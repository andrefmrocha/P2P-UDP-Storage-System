Java version: 8

The applications can be executed via 2 different ways:
- Pre-defined scenarios:
  1. Using the script 'run_scenario.sh', where some pre-defined scenarios of execution where automated.
     It starts by compiling and then, according to the given scenario, starts the peers and clients accordingly.
     Running without arguments shows how to use it.

- Manually
  1. Compile the programs using the script 'compile.sh'.
  2. Start the peers using the script 'run_peers.sh'. Running it without arguments tells you how the script can be run.
  3. Send client requests using the 'run_client.sh' script. Again, running without arguments shows how to use it.
